## CAD files

## Initial test

All PCB's are tested and the VIAL QMK firmware is already flashed on both sides.

I recommend to test each switch position for functionality, before you solder the switches.

Connect both half's with a USB-C to USB-C cable and connect one side with a USB-C cable to your computer.

> The pre flashed firmware use ["Handedness by EEPROM"](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=handedness-by-eeprom), so it does not matter which half is master (connected to the computer).  
> The layout can be mirrored if "Handedness by EEPROM" is not used.

Open [QMK Configurator page](https://config.qmk.fm/#/test) and bridge each switch solder point pair with a tweezers. It should trigger a key press. If not please contact me.

## Visual enhancement (optional)

This step is not necessary, but will improve visually appealing of your 3W6 split keyboard.

Due to the manufacturing process of the PCB's, there are some rough edges. Use a small file to remove these marks (mouse bites).

You could also paint the edges black with a black Sharpie/Edding.

## Assembly

Attach the Choc V1 switches (36x) to the top plates and pay attention to the switch orientation. The lower row has a different orientation.

Check carefully if all switch pins are staight.

![3w6 top plate with switches from bottom view](img/3w6-split-keyboard-kit-black-pcb-build-guide-1.jpg)

Put the 3D printed spacer on the back of the top plate.  

![3w6 3d printed spacer plates on top of the PCB's](img/3w6-split-keyboard-kit-black-pcb-build-guide-3.jpg)

Place the pcb (SMD components must face down) on the top plate with the switches spacer.  
Do not press to hard. Check if all switch pins are align with the holes in the PCB.

![alt](img/3w6-split-keyboard-kit-black-pcb-build-guide-4.jpg)

If all switch pins are aligned, press the top plate and the PCB together.  
If you have problems to close the gap, probably a switch pin is bent.

While you press the PCB down, solder all switch pin's (green marked)

![alt](img/3w6-split-keyboard-kit-black-pcb-build-guide-4.jpg)

Connect both half's with a USB-C to USB-C cable and connect one half with a USB-C cable to your computer.

Open [QMK Configurator page](https://config.qmk.fm/#/test) and test if all switches trigger a key press. If not check the corresponding solder point for the switch.

If everything works as expected, you can attach the self-adhesive foam to the underside.

The complete assembled 3W6 Split Keyboard should have 4 layers  
*The self-adhesive protection foil was not removed for demonstration purpose.*

## Firmware

The [VIAL QMK firmware](https://get.vial.today) with the [vial keymap](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/keycapsss/3w6_2040/keymaps/vial) is already flashed on both half's.

To customize the layout of your 3W6, [download](https://get.vial.today/download/) the VIAL GUI, or use the [web version](https://vial.rocks/).
The keyboard should be detected right out of the box.

### Customize the firmware (optional)

With the command below, you compile the vial keymap for the 3w6 [(after setting up your build environment)](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs):

```bash
make keycapsss/3w6_2040:vial:uf2-split-right
```

You will find a `keycapsss_3w6_2040_vial.uf2` in the qmk folder. Rename it to `keycapsss_3w6_2040_vial_right.uf2` and do the same for the left firmware file (replace `right` with `left`).

### Bootloader (flash firmware)

1. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and connect the half to the computer.
2. A mass storage drive (RPI-RP2) should appear. You can release the BOOTSEL button.
3. Drag and drop the UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 volume. The 3W6 will reboot.

## Pimoroni Trackball

This 3W6 keyboard supports a trackball module on both sides (left side only, right side only, or on both sides simultaneously).

The trackball module is already activated in the default flashed firmware.

The trackball is connected via I2C to the mcu.
Since Rev1.1 the INT (interrupt pin) is connected to the GPIO24 pin.  
Right now *(05.2023)* the QMK [driver for the Pimoroni Trackball module](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_pointing_device?id=pimoroni-trackball) do not use the INT pin.

### Trackball module assembly

1. Solder the header pin to the module (plastic part at the bottom).  
   Carefully remove the plastic from the header pins (marked red) with pliers.

   ![alt](img/3w6-pimoroni-trackball-1.jpg)
2. On the side you want to install the trackball module, break away the red marked part. There is a predetermined breaking point at the vertical red line.

   ![alt](img/3w6-pimoroni-trackball-2.jpg)

3. Place the module on the top side of the pcb. The module should sit on the pcb, without a gap (green arrow).  
   The module should be align with the white tactile switch next to it. If not, it could be that the plastic cover of the trackball do not fit in the cutout in the top plate.  
   Solder the header pins from the bottom.

   ![alt](img/3w6-pimoroni-trackball-3.jpg)

4. Cut the header pins as close as possible to the pcb and reflow the solder points again (looks better).

   *Ignore the pixelated part, it's from a prototype.*
