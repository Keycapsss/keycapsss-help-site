## Firmware

Clone/download the QMK firmware and execute the following in the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) directory to write the default Lily58L keymap

    make lily58/light:lily58l:avrdude

When **`Detecting USB port, reset your controller now...`** is displayed, press the reset button on the keyboard to start writing.
Each half of the keyboard must be programmed separately using this approach.

If you're using DFU bootloader (in case of the elite c), replace the 'avrdude' with 'dfu'
