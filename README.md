## Battery (read carefully)

- Puchi-BLE supports 1S LiPo batteries (4.2V)
- Only use LiPo batteries with a protection circuit, because the Puchi-BLE has no low voltes (discharge) protection for batteries ![LiPo battery 301230 with protection circuit](./img/lipo-301230.jpg)
- A 301230 (3.0 x 12 x 30 mm) LiPo battery fit between 4.5mm tall pin sockets
- Connect the battery to B+ (red) and B- (black ), or RAW (red) and GND (black) (these pairs of pins are internally connected)
- __Avoid reverse polarity__ (nRF52840 chip is usually destroyed first)
- __Note that a few keyboards have RAW and VCC pins connected together (namely Helix and Gherkin), and will kill the controller__ (RAW pin is for the charger only). You may just not solder RAW pin to the keyboard as a workaround.

> I don't offer LiPo batteries in the shop, because of the German strict law.

## Bootloader

A customized [Adafruit nRF52 Bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases) is flashed on the Puchi-BLE.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/joric/7226eda8d5fdba44bc64d4520825a11d) you can find the changes from the original Adafruit nRF52 Bootloader.

The Bootloader binary already contain the Bluetooth stack (a.k.a SoftDevice).

### How to enter the bootloader mode

Press RESET (short RST with GND) twice within 500ms.  
The blue led will start slowly dimming and a Mass Storage (NRF52BOOT) should appear in your file explorer.

Now you can copy the ZMK UF2 firmware file on it.

## Status Led's

- Red solid: power connected
- Blue 2x blinking: restart
- Blue slow flashing (every 3sec): ~~waiting for bluetooth connection~~
- Blue fast flashing:
- Blue off: ~~connected via bluetooth~~
- Blue slow dimming: USB Mass Storage mode, for firmware update
- Blue solid: ?

## Firmware

### ZMK

[Detailed documentation](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/ZMK) by Joric

[Setup local ZMK environment](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/) (with VS Code & Docker is the easiest), or use the [Github action method](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup).

Build UF2 firmware file for Corne left side ...

```bash
west build -p -d build/left -b puchi_ble_v1 -- -DSHIELD=corne_left
```

After a successful build, you can find the UF2 firmware file in the `app/build/left/zephyr/zmk.uf2` folder.

... and right side.

```bash
west build -p -d build/right -b puchi_ble_v1 -- -DSHIELD=corne_right
```

More information about 'Building For Split Keyboards' [here](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/build-flash#building-for-split-keyboards).

[Here](./firmware/) you can find the precompiled firmware files (UF2) for the Corne and Lily58 keyboard.

### QMK (nrf52 branch)

## FAQ

- Do i need a TRRS cable to connect the split keyboard halfs?
  - No, the slave side connects wireless to the master side. Optional you can use a cable (no charge over TRRS cable).
- What's the battery life?
  - Approximately 2weeks with a 100mAh battery (no oled, or led‘s).
- Is there a lag while typing?
  - Bluetooth devices can reach a latency of 1.3 ms. Lower latency means more power drain and reduce the battery life.
- Is it possible to switch between Bluetooth devices?
  - Yes, QMK and ZMK have support for up to 5 Bluetooth profiles.
- What batteries work with the Puchi-BLE?
  - LiPo batteries with 1S. Also important is that the LiPo batterie has a protection circuit
- Are batteries available in the shop?
  - No, due to the german law, i don’t offer batteries in the shop. You can get LiPo batteries on Ebay and Aliexpress.
- What are the EXT_VCC and EXT_GND? Are they the same pins as VCC and GND?
  - Yes. Power output is sofware-controlled to save battery (RGB LEDs draw up to 1 mA each when off).
